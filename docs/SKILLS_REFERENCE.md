# 🧪 NUCLEAR SKILLS REFERENCE

This document provides a deep technical dive into the **7 Elite P0 Skills** that power Sufian's Frontend Designer.

---

## S1: Project DNA Analyzer (`project-dna-analyzer.py`)
**Mantra:** *Listen to the code's heartbeat.*

Scans for 20+ "Elite Markers" that define high-tier design engineering.
- **Modern CSS**: Anchor Positioning, `:has()`, View Transitions, OKLCH.
- **AI-Smell**: Detects perfect grids, template color palettes, and clinical alignments.
- **Integrity Score**: Calculated based on the presence of hand-crafted patterns.

## S2: Color Personality Generator (`color-personality-generator.py`)
**Mantra:** *Colors should have a soul, not a hex code.*

Uses 12 psychological archetypes to generate palettes that are:
- **HSL-Odd**: Never uses "perfect" 40% or 50% lightness.
- **WCAG AAA**: Built-in accessibility validation.
- **Dark-Mode Aware**: Perceptual adjustments for OLED screens.

## S3: Spring Physics Calculator (`spring-physics-calculator.py`)
**Mantra:** *Physics is the only honest way to animate.*

Calculates real movement based on **Hooke's Law**.
- **Presets**: Snappy, Bouncy, Gentle, Wobbly.
- **Exports**: Framer Motion, CSS, React Spring.
- **Settle-Time Math**: Ensures animations don't vibrate forever.

## S4: Quirk Injector (`quirk-injector.py`)
**Mantra:** *Imperfection is a feature.*

Surgically injects "Human Signals" into sterile components.
- **Subtle Rotations**: -0.5deg to 1deg.
- **Irregular Radii**: Fibonacci-based corner values.
- **Wobbly Underlines**: SVG-based hand-drawn effects.

## S5: Microcopy Humanizer (`microcopy-humanizer.py`)
**Mantra:** *Talk like a human, not a form.*

Replaces generic system labels with playful, high-personality copy.
- **"Save"** → "Lock it in! 🔒"
- **"Cancel"** → "Nah, maybe later"
- **"Error"** → "Oops, something drifted."

## S6: Human vs AI Scorer (`human-vs-ai-scorer.py`)
**Mantra:** *The brutal truth.*

A 6-category validator that gives a final "Handcrafted" vs "AI-Generated" verdict.
- Threshold for "Elite" status is **85/100**.

## S7: A11y & CSS Architect (`a11y-personality.py`)
**Mantra:** *Structure is the soul of performance.*

Implements cutting-edge CSS features and conversational accessibility patterns that AI agents usually miss.
