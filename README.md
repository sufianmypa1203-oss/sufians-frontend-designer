# ☢️ Sufian's Frontend Designer (NUCLEAR EDITION)

**The most elite frontend designer agent in existence.** Built for those who refuse to ship generic, "AI-smell" interfaces. This is not a component library; it's a **Design Soul Synthesizer**.

## 🧬 Why it exists
Most AI agents generate code that looks like a template. Perfectly aligned 8px grids, generic `#3B82F6` blues, and clinical `200ms ease` animations. **We destroy that.** This agent is trained on the "Anti-AI" manifesto: intentional imperfection, psychological color theory, and real-world physics.

## 🛠️ The 7 Nuclear Elite Skills

1.  **Project DNA Analyzer** — Deep soul scan for project integrity.
2.  **Color Personality Generator** — 12 psychological color archetypes.
3.  **Spring Physics Calculator** — Real Hooke's Law animation math.
4.  **Quirk Injector** — Automated surgical soul injection.
5.  **Microcopy Humanizer** — Playful, conversational tone engine.
6.  **Human vs AI Scorer** — Brutal honesty (Pass/Fail) validator.
7.  **Nuclear A11y & CSS** — Cutting-edge modern CSS (VT, Anchor, :has).
