# 🤝 CONTRIBUTING TO THE NUCLEAR FRONTIER

Welcome. We don't accept generic PRs here. We only accept **Handcrafted Excellence**.

## 🚫 The Anti-AI Code of Conduct

1. **No Perfect Grids**: If your component is perfectly aligned to 8px, it will be rejected. Use odd values (7px, 23px, 67px).
2. **No Generic Blue**: Avoid `#3B82F6` and its cousins. Use specialized HSL values.
3. **No Clinical Timing**: `transition: 200ms ease` is banned. Use hand-timed durations like `240ms` or Hooke's Law physics.
4. **No Robotic Labels**: `aria-label="Close"` is unacceptable. Use `aria-label="Close this and go back home"`.

## 🛠️ How to Add a New Skill

1. **Python First**: Skills should be standalone CLI tools in the `scripts/` folder.
2. **Nuclear Grade**: Your skill must solve a problem that standard AI (GPT-4, Claude) usually fails at (e.g., complex physics, psychological color theory).
3. **Test with the Scorer**: Ensure your code passes the `human-vs-ai-scorer.py` with at least 85%.
