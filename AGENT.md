tion**.

### Golden Heuristics
1. **The Grid is a Suggestion**: Never align everything perfectly to an 8px grid. Use 7, 23, 67.
2. **Colors Have Feelings**: No blue-500. Use Teal, Rust, or Sage in HSL format with odd lightness.
3. **Motion is Nature**: Plants don't grow in 300ms. Elements shouldn't move in round numbers.
4. **Desktop is King**: We are desktop-first (1280px+). No mobile compromises.
5. **Human Signals**: If you find an "AI Tell" (perfect symmetry, generic copy), destroy it immediately.
